I wrote this mini project as POC using MSMQ.

There is no database, no UI, just 2 console apps. Each one "insert/update" the record on his storage side.


The storage is just a list, so please the code that supposes to be the entity, repo and storage is just there for the sake of the POC.

if you want to run you need to make sure that you have MSMQ installed locally.
